with this website the user who grant a Moderator privileges can write and manage articles. Besides, 
every login user can comment, like and bookmark articles, also s/he has his/her own profile where the written and/or bookmarked articles are listed there.

# Agile workflow

With the use of GitHub's kanban board, issues have been listed with labels for each, prioritising them in a manner that meets the project objective.

1. Adding essential features first
   - Backend functionalities have been added as a first iteration (install required libraries, create database with related tables, CRUD functionalities).
   - As a next step, templates and views that relate to CRUD have been done as a second iteration.
   - authentication with allauth take a place as a third step after testing the CRUD.
2. GitHub Features / Issues
   - The user stories have been given a Github issue, each is prioritized and is a given one of three labels (Must have , Should have, Could have).
     ![Issues](https://res.cloudinary.com/nazek/image/upload/v1690833977/readme/issues.png).

# Implementation Plan
The implementation plan have been written for each [user story](#user-stories) individually, 
available at the [backlog](https://github.com/users/Nazek-Altayeb/projects/3).
By clicking on each user story, details of how the feature is implemented will be displayed.

# Validation

## Validation Guide

All written files have been validated, besides the website accessability and performance are validates as well,
validation  results available at the following [Validation guide](VALIDATION.md) 

# Technologies

## Environments and Hosting

- [Lucid](https://lucid.app/) (ERD diagrams)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) (Version control)
- [Codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com) (IDE)
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) (Site hosting)
- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) (Serving static media files)

## Libraries

- [Gunicorn](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/howto/deployment/wsgi/gunicorn/) (Python HTTP server for WSGI applications)
- [pyscopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/) (PostgreSQL Database adapter)
- [django-allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (User authentication)
- [django-crispy-forms](https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Control rendering behaviour of Django forms)

### Database

- [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) (PostgreSQL database hosting)

# Deployment

#### Install libraries

Below are the libraries needed for deployment on Heroku.  For full explanation on how to install these libraries, refer to the links provided in [Technologies](#technologies).

- Install **Gunicorn** (server used to run Django on Heroku): ``pip3 install django gunicorn``
- Install **pyscopg2** (connects to PostgreSQL): ``pip 3 install dj_database_url pyscopg2``
- Install **Cloudinary** (host static files and images): ``pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage``

#### Create the Heroku App

- Log into Heroku and go to the Dashboard
- Click **New** and select **Create new app** from the drop-down
- Name app appropriately and choose relevant region, then click **Create App**

#### Create PostgreSQL database using ElephantSQL

This is necessary to create a database that can be accessed by Heroku. as it's not possible to access the database provided by Django by the deployed Heroku app.

- Log into ElephantSQL and go to Dashboard
- Click **Create New Instance**
- Set up a plan by providing a Name (project name) and select a Plan (for this project the free plan "Tiny Turtle" was chosen). Tags are optional.
- Click **Select Region** and choose appropriate Data center
- Click **Review**, check all details and click **Create Instance**
- Return to Dashboard on click on the name of the newly created instance
- Copy the database URL from the details section

#### Hide sensitive data

- Create ``env.py`` file and ensure it is included in the ``.gitignore`` file
- Add ``import os`` to env.py file and set environment variable **DATABASE_URL** to the URL copied from ElephantSQL (``os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]="<copiedURL>"``)
- Below, set **SECRET_KEY** variable (``os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]="mysecretkey"``, but be more inventive about the key string!)

#### Update Settings

- Add the following code at the top of ``settings.py`` to connect Django project to env.py:

    ````
      import os
      import dj_database_url
      if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
          import env
    ````

- Remove insecure secret key provide by Django in settings.py and refer to variable in env.py instead (``SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')``)

- To connect to new database, replace provided **DATABASE** variable with

    ````
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
    }
    ````

- Save and migrate all changes made

#### Connect Heroku to Database

- In Heroku dashboard, go to **Settings** tab
- Add three new config vars **DATABASE_URL** (value is database URL), **SECRET_KEY** (value is secret key string) and **PORT** (value "8000")

#### Connect to Cloudinary

- In Cloudinary dashboard, copy **API Environment variable**
- In ``env.py`` file, add new variable ``os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "<copied_variable"`` and remove ``CLOUDINARY_URL=`` from the variable string
- Add same variable value as new Heroku config var named **CLOUDINARY_URL**
- In ``settings.py``, in ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list, above ``django.contrib.staticfiles`` add ``cloudinary_storage``, below add ``cloudinary``
- To define Cloudinary as static file storage add the following to settings.py

    ````
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'

    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
    ````

#### Set hosts

- In ``settings.py`` add

    ````
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['app-name.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
    ````
